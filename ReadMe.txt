Final Project
We are creating a text-based adventure game with the use of image manipulation and light sound manipulation. We plan on proposing a visual map of the rooms with audio clues within each room that reveal directions to the secret room. There will be an indicator symbol on the visual map that represents where the player is. The win and lose aspect will contain an audio cue.  

Erica - write the item class and player class
Dalia - write the room class and map class
Jasper - write the audio class and create/gather audio clip cues
